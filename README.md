## Features

### Available now

- **PDF viewing**
  - Continuous, single page and two page layouts.
  - Zoom, fit to page or width, actual size, Ctrl+scroll zoom.
  - Sharp at any zoom: pages render in tiles on background threads.
  - Password protected documents.
- **Sidebar:** page thumbnails, table of contents and bookmarks, resizable
  by dragging its edge.
- **Search** with every match highlighted and next/previous navigation.
- **PDF markup,** as in Preview's markup toolbar:
  - Highlight, underline and strikethrough text, in five colors.
  - Sketch (strokes become rectangles, ovals and lines when they look like
    one), draw, and shapes: rectangle, rounded rectangle, oval, line,
    arrow, star, polygon, speech bubble, loupe and mask.
  - Text boxes and notes, with fonts, sizes, colors and alignment; in a
    text box, selected text can be bold, italic or a color of its own,
    saved as PDF rich text that other readers show.
  - Border and fill colors, line widths and dashes.
  - Select, move, resize, restyle and delete annotations; undo and redo.
  - Paste an image or text from the clipboard onto the page, whatever
    tool is chosen (on Linux, images need wl-clipboard), or drop one
    where it should go.
  - Everything is saved as standard PDF annotations that other viewers
    show and edit.
- **Drag and drop** both ways, on Linux, Windows and macOS
  ([details](https://prev.run/guide.html#drag-and-drop)):
  - Drop images, text, files and pages from other windows and apps
    where they should go: images and text onto pages or an image's
    markup, pages, PDFs and images (as new pages) among the thumbnails,
    image files into an image window, and other files into windows of
    their own. A PDF file dropped on a page asks whether to add it to
    the end or open it on its own.
  - Ctrl (Control on macOS) sends a drop on the page view to the sidebar:
    among the pages, or with an image window's images.
  - Drag an image annotation onto the thumbnails to make it a page, or
    onto an image window's sidebar to save it as an image there.
  - Drag selected text, areas (as images), pages (to another document,
    or to the file manager as a PDF) and sidebar images (as their files)
    out of prev.
  - Shift (or Command on macOS) moves pages instead of copying them.
  - Pictures from web pages that join an image window are saved to
    Downloads first.
  - Pictures dragged from a browser arrive at full size; where a browser
    gives only their address, prev downloads them with curl if it is
    installed.
- **Forms:** fill in text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons and drop-down
  menus.
- **Signatures:** draw one (with a choice of ink and pen thickness), type
  your name in a handwriting font, or import a photo or scan; keep as many
  as you like and place them on any page.
- **Page editing:**
  - Select pages in the sidebar (Ctrl+click and Shift+click for more) and
    drag them to reorder.
  - Rotate, delete, crop to a selection, insert a blank page or the pages
    of another PDF, by choosing it or dropping it on the thumbnails.
  - Drag pages to another document window, or out as a PDF file.
  - Copy pages and paste them into the same or another document window,
    with their annotations and form fields.
  - Every page edit can be undone.
- **Redaction:** mark areas or selected text with the Redact tool, then
  apply: the text, images and drawings underneath are removed from the
  file for good, not just covered, and the file is rewritten so no earlier
  revision keeps them.
- **Export** the whole document or selected pages as PDF, optionally
  flattened (markup and filled-in fields drawn into the pages, no longer
  editable), encrypted with a password (AES-256) or made smaller by
  downsampling images, or as PNG, JPEG, multi-page TIFF, WebP or OpenEXR at 72 to
  600 dpi.
- **Highlights and notes** sidebar listing every annotation with its text.
- **Inspector** (Ctrl+I, [details](https://prev.run/guide.html#inspector)) with the file, the document information (title,
  author, dates, producer, PDF version, encryption) and page size.
- **Autosave:** edits are written in place a moment after you stop, with
  the original kept for Revert To.
- **Text selection and copy**, including across pages; double-click selects a
  word, triple-click a line. A rectangular selection copies an area as an
  image (on Linux, this needs wl-clipboard).
- **Links** inside the document and to the web.
- **Slideshow**, full screen and printing through the system print dialog.
- **Images:** PNG, JPEG, GIF and animated GIF, WebP, AVIF, HEIC, TIFF, BMP,
  ICO, TGA, PNM, QOI, JPEG 2000, OpenEXR, Radiance HDR and camera RAW
  from the cameras [rawler](https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab) supports.
  RAW photos open looking like the camera's own JPEG: prev matches its
  tone curves to the preview the camera stores in the file.
  - Images opened together share one window with a thumbnail sidebar;
    drop more image files on the window to add them.
  - Zoom, fit, actual size, Ctrl+scroll zoom and drag to pan.
  - HEIC and AVIF open through libheif: the system's on Linux, built in
    on Windows, macOS and in the Flatpak.
- **Image editing:** rotate, flip, crop, resize and Adjust Color (exposure,
  contrast, saturation, temperature, tint, sepia, sharpness and levels),
  with undo.
  - Edits save automatically, keeping EXIF, color profiles and XMP (in
    JPEG, PNG, WebP and TIFF); the original is kept for Revert To.
  - Inspector with the file's details, camera details, Remove Location
    Info, keywords and description.
  - Markup with the PDF tools (draw, shapes, text, notes, signatures),
    kept while the window is open and drawn into the image on export;
    closing asks first if markup hasn't been exported.
  - Export to PNG, JPEG, WebP, TIFF, BMP, TGA, QOI, PPM or OpenEXR.
- **SVG** drawings, sharp at any zoom; export them as PNG, JPEG and the
  other image formats at one, two or four times their size.
- **Markdown** with tables, task lists, syntax highlighted code and images;
  reloads when the file changes on disk. Text size, search and an
  inspector, as in the other windows, and export as a picture.
- **Material Design 3 interface:** an
  [M3 Expressive](https://m3.material.io) look with Roboto Flex, Material
  Symbols icons, spring motion and keyboard focus (Tab and Shift+Tab).
  - Colors are generated from the system's accent color (the desktop
    theme's on Linux, Windows' and macOS's own), or from prev's own blue,
    in light or dark.
  - Documents and images share one toolbar layout: what is shown and the
    view on the left, editing, panels and export on the right.
  - In narrow windows, toolbar groups that don't fit move into a More
    menu, which closes once you choose from it.
  - Optionally, the toolbar floats over the document as an M3 floating
    toolbar, with the markup bar along the bottom, and hides while the
    pointer is outside the window.
- **Settings** (the gear button or Ctrl+,), in tabs: appearance, the
  system accent color, the floating toolbar and its transparency,
  animations, corner radius, the interface and input languages, the
  assistant's models, the agents allowed to control prev, and where
  signatures, version history and bookmarks are kept. They are saved in `~/.config/prev.toml`
  (`%APPDATA%\prev\prev.toml` on Windows,
  `~/Library/Application Support/prev/prev.toml` on macOS).
- **Assistant**: a chat panel beside the document (the robot head on
  the toolbar) that answers about the file and works in it with the
  same tools as an outside agent: finding and pointing at things,
  marking up, editing, signing, redacting and exporting, as you ask
  it, without asking again. It talks to a model you add in
  Settings: a local model, such as Ollama's, that stays on your
  computer, or a cloud model from Anthropic, OpenAI or Google with your
  API key,
  kept in the system's keychain. Each window has its own chat, and the
  model can be changed mid-chat. See
  [Using the assistant](#using-the-assistant).
- **AI agents**: `prev --mcp` serves prev's tools over MCP, so Claude
  Code or a local model in an MCP client can read, show, mark up, edit,
  sign, redact and export in the prev you are using, asking you first
  where Settings says to. prev bundles no model and listens on no
  network. See [Using prev with AI agents](#using-prev-with-ai-agents).
- **Desktop integration**
  - One window per document, with a single running instance.
  - Open files from the file dialog or by dragging them onto a window.
  - Drag and drop with other apps both ways, on Wayland, Windows and
    macOS.
  - On macOS, a menu bar laid out like Preview's, ⌘ shortcuts, and files
    opened from Finder and the Dock go to the running prev.
  - Follows the system light or dark setting, accent color and reduced
    motion setting as they change.
  - On Windows and macOS, the toolbars, panels and dialogs take the
    system's title bar color, which runs on into prev's toolbar.
  - On Linux desktops that draw no title bars, such as Hyprland, niri
    and river, the toolbar ends with a button that closes the window.

### Planned

- Revert To for PDFs, as images have it.
- Dragging annotations between documents.
- prev on winget and the AUR.
- Signed and notarized macOS releases.

The [development plan](docs/PLAN.md#not-built-yet) lists more.

## Install

prev runs on Linux under Wayland (X11 works too) and on Windows 10 and 11,
on 64-bit x86 and ARM, on Linux also RISC-V, and on macOS 11 or later on
Apple Silicon. It draws with the GPU through Vulkan, DirectX 12 on
Windows or Metal on macOS, and falls back to drawing on the CPU when
none is available.
Each [release](https://github.com/scrambletools/prev/releases) has these
packages:

| System | How |
|---|---|
| Arch | Until prev is on the AUR, build it from the release's PKGBUILD (below) |
| Debian and Ubuntu | `sudo apt install ./prev_2.2.2-1_amd64.deb` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install ./prev-2.2.2-1.x86_64.rpm` |
| Flatpak | `flatpak install --user prev-x86_64.flatpak` (or `prev-aarch64.flatpak`) |
| Any distribution | the AppImage: `chmod +x prev-2.2.2-x86_64.AppImage`, then run it |
| Any distribution | `prev-2.2.2-x86_64-linux.tar.gz`, a plain binary and data files to unpack under `/usr` or `~/.local` |
| Any distribution, with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) | `mise use -g github:scrambletools/prev` |
| Windows 10 and 11 | the `.msi` installer: open it; it installs for you alone, with no administrator prompt |
| Windows, portable | the `-windows.zip`: unpack it anywhere and run `prev.exe` |
| macOS 11 or later, Apple Silicon | `prev-2.2.2-arm64.dmg`: open it and drag prev to Applications |

Each file is named for the machine it runs on: `x86_64` (`amd64` in
Debian's names, `x64` on Windows), `aarch64` (`arm64` in Debian's and
Windows' names) or `riscv64`. The commands above are for x86_64.

On Arch, until the AUR packages are published:

```sh
mkdir prev && cd prev
curl -LO https://github.com/scrambletools/prev/releases/download/v2.2.2/PKGBUILD
curl -LO https://github.com/scrambletools/prev/releases/download/v2.2.2/prev.install
makepkg -si
```

This builds prev from the release's source, which takes a few minutes
(MuPDF is compiled too).

The packages suggest wl-clipboard, libheif and curl, which prev uses
when they are installed (see [Building](#building)); the Flatpak has them
built in. prev is not on Flathub, but its Flatpak takes the Freedesktop
runtime from there and offers to add the Flathub remote when it is
missing. The Flatpak keeps its settings and data under
`~/.var/app/io.github.scrambletools.prev`.

### What differs between packages

Every package has every feature. Some depend on where prev runs:

- **Wayland or X11:** drag and drop, pasting images and copying an area
  as an image need Wayland. Under X11, text still copies and pastes.
- **HEIC and AVIF** need libheif with its decoders: on Debian and Ubuntu
  the `libheif-plugin-*` packages, on Fedora `libheif-freeworld` from RPM
  Fusion (Fedora's own libheif leaves out HEIC).
- **Flatpak:** prev reaches the home folder; files elsewhere (other
  drives, `/tmp`) open through the file dialog, but dropping them from
  the file manager does not work. Its settings, signatures and versions
  are its own, apart from a non-Flatpak install's.
- **AppImage:** not wired into the desktop by itself, so there is no
  launcher entry or "Open With" unless a tool such as AppImageLauncher
  adds one. It needs glibc 2.35 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12,
  Fedora 36 and later), as do the .deb and .rpm.
- **mise:** installs the release's plain binary and puts only `prev` on
  your PATH, so there is no launcher entry, icon or "Open With"; start
  it from a terminal. It updates with `mise up`; mise waits a day after
  a release before offering it. Like the tarball, it does not install
  wl-clipboard, libheif or curl.
- **Windows:**
  - Installed from the MSI, prev is in the Start menu and under "Open
    with". To make it the default app for a file type, choose it in
    Settings, Apps, Default apps: Windows lets only you choose.
  - Settings are in `%APPDATA%\prev\prev.toml`, with signatures, version
    history and bookmarks beside it.
  - HEIC and AVIF work out of the box, as libheif comes with prev.
  - Colors follow the accent color set in Settings, Personalization,
    Colors.
- **macOS:**
  - The app is not yet signed with an Apple Developer ID or notarized,
    so macOS blocks it the first time: open it once, then choose Open
    Anyway in System Settings, Privacy & Security.
  - Settings are in `~/Library/Application Support/prev/prev.toml`, with
    signatures, version history and bookmarks beside it.
  - Shortcuts use ⌘ where Linux and Windows use Ctrl, and the menus are
    in the menu bar.
  - Command, as well as Shift, moves pages dragged out, as in Finder.
  - HEIC and AVIF work out of the box, as a decode-only libheif comes
    with prev.
  - Printing uses the system print panel, with pages drawn as prev shows
    them.
- **Holding Shift or Ctrl** during a drop from another app is seen only
  under compositors that move keyboard focus with the pointer, such as
  Hyprland.
- **RISC-V** has the .deb, .rpm and tarball, but no AppImage or Flatpak:
  appimagetool and the Flatpak runtime are not built for it.

Some Hyprland setups make every window slightly see-through, which dims
photos and pages. `scripts/install.sh` adds a Hyprland rule keeping prev
opaque; with a package, add it to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua`:

```lua
o.window("^io\\.github\\.scrambletools\\.prev$", { tag = "-default-opacity", opacity = "1 1" })
```

## Using the assistant

Open Settings, Assistant, and pick a provider:

- **Ollama** (or another server on your computer, such as LM Studio or
  llama.cpp's): prev finds the running server and lists its models, with
  whether each can use tools, which the assistant needs, and see
  pictures. Add one, and choose how much it reads at once (more takes
  more memory). Use another address reaches a server on another
  computer.
- **Anthropic, OpenAI or Google Gemini**: make an API key on the
  provider's site (Get an API key opens the page) and paste it; prev
  lists the provider's chat models, the recommended one first. The key
  is kept once for all that provider's models. A new OpenAI or Anthropic
  account needs some credit bought before its key works; prev says so.

Adding a model sends it one short message first, and adds it once it
answers. Then the robot head on the toolbar opens the panel. The model
gets only what it asks for through the tools, never the whole file up
front; with a cloud model, that goes to the provider. Thinking models
show their reasoning as they work, folded away once they answer. When a
chat grows longer than a local model can read at once, its earlier part
is summarized so the chat can go on, and the panel says so.

## Using prev with AI agents

Add prev to an agent as an MCP server that runs `prev --mcp`. For Claude
Code:

```sh
claude mcp add prev -- prev --mcp
```

Where `prev` is not on the path, give its whole path:
`/Applications/prev.app/Contents/MacOS/prev` on macOS,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\prev\prev.exe` on Windows, or
`flatpak run io.github.scrambletools.prev` for the Flatpak. MCP clients
for local models take the same command, often as
`{ "mcpServers": { "prev": { "command": "prev", "args": ["--mcp"] } } }`.

The first time an agent connects, prev asks whether to let it in. Settings
turns outside control off, lists the agents allowed, and has a switch for
each kind of tool (reading, the view, markup, edits, signing, redacting
and exporting) that makes prev ask before an agent's call runs; signing
and redacting ask at first. What the agent reads goes to its model. The
[guide](https://prev.run/guide.html#ai-agents) has more.

### Assistant and agents at a glance

| | Supported |
|---|---|
| Cloud models | Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, with your own key; suggests Claude Sonnet 5.5, GPT-5.6, Gemini 3.8 Flash |
| Local models | Ollama (`localhost:11434`), LM Studio (`:1234`), llama.cpp (`:8080`), vLLM (`:8000`), or any address |
| A model needs | Tool calling; pictures are optional |
| MCP server | `prev --mcp` over standard input and output; no network port |
| Tools (44) | 11 to read, 11 for the view, 7 for markup, 12 to edit, and one each to sign, redact and export |

Every tool by name is in the [specifications](https://prev.run/specs.html#ai).

## Building

prev builds with Rust 1.95 or newer. On Linux it needs these build
dependencies:

```sh
# Arch
sudo pacman -S clang pkgconf fontconfig freetype2 libxkbcommon wayland
# Debian and Ubuntu
sudo apt install clang libclang-dev pkg-config libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev
```

Then build and run:

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/prev document.pdf
```

MuPDF is compiled from source as part of the build.

On Windows, install the Visual Studio C++ build tools and LLVM, set
`LIBCLANG_PATH` to LLVM's `bin` folder and `BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS` to
`-isystem "<LLVM>\lib\clang\<version>\include"` (see
`packaging/windows/bindgen-headers.ps1`), then run the same
`cargo build`.
For HEIC and AVIF, put `heif.dll` beside `prev.exe`; vcpkg builds it from
`packaging/windows/vcpkg` (see the README there). `packaging/windows/build.ps1`
makes the MSI and zip with WiX.

On macOS, install the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select
--install`), then run the same `cargo build`. `packaging/macos/bundle.sh`
makes `prev.app` (and with `--dmg` the disk image). For HEIC and AVIF,
`packaging/macos/build-libheif.sh` first builds a decode-only libheif for
it to include (it needs cmake and ninja); without one, `bundle.sh` copies
Homebrew's libheif for use on that Mac.

On Linux, prev runs without these, but uses them when they are
installed:

- **wl-clipboard** (`wl-copy`, `wl-paste`): pasting images, and copying
  an area as an image. Text copies and pastes without it.
- **libheif**: opening HEIC and AVIF images.
- **curl**: fetching a picture dropped from a browser that gives only
  its web address; without it the address arrives as text.

To install prev for your user, with a desktop entry so it shows up in the
launcher and "Open With":

```sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

On Linux, this puts the binary in `~/.local/bin` and the desktop entry, icons and
man page under `~/.local/share`, and on Hyprland setups that make windows see-through adds the opacity
rule above (set `PREV_NO_HYPRLAND=1` to skip it). Settings are in
`~/.config/prev.toml`, which also says where signatures, version history
and bookmarks are kept. Builds made with plain `cargo build` or
`cargo run` are development builds: they keep their own settings
(`~/.config/prev-dev.toml`) and data under `prev-dev`, show "(dev)" in
window titles, and run alongside the installed copy without handing files
to it. Packages are built with `PREV_PRODUCTION=1`; see
[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

## Keyboard shortcuts

On macOS, use ⌘ in place of Ctrl, and ⌥ in place of Alt; the menu bar
lists each shortcut too.

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Open | Ctrl+O |
| Find, next, previous | Ctrl+F, Ctrl+G, Ctrl+Shift+G |
| Zoom in, out, actual size, fit | Ctrl+=, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+0, Ctrl+9 |
| Go to page | Ctrl+Alt+G |
| Bookmark page | Ctrl+D |
| Sidebar: hide, thumbnails, contents, highlights and notes, bookmarks | Ctrl+Alt+1, 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| Show markup toolbar (PDFs and images) | Ctrl+Shift+A |
| Delete the selected annotation or pages | Delete |
| Paste an image or text from the clipboard | Ctrl+V |
| Copy, paste pages (after clicking a thumbnail) | Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V |
| Select all pages (after clicking a thumbnail) | Ctrl+A |
| Slideshow | Ctrl+Shift+F |
| Full screen | F11 |
| Rotate left, right | Ctrl+L, Ctrl+R |
| Crop to selection | Ctrl+K |
| Undo, redo | Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z |
| Adjust Color (images), Inspector | Ctrl+Shift+C, Ctrl+I |
| Bold, italic, while typing in a text box | Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I |
| Export | Ctrl+Shift+S |
| Print | Ctrl+P |
| Settings | Ctrl+, |

### Changing shortcuts

Shortcuts can be changed in the `[keys]` table of the settings file:
`~/.config/prev.toml`, `%APPDATA%\prev\prev.toml` on Windows, or
`~/Library/Application Support/prev/prev.toml` on macOS. There is no
place for them in the Settings dialog. Each entry
names an action and gives it one shortcut, a list of them, or an empty
list for none; the action's default shortcuts no longer apply, and a
shortcut given to one action is taken from any other. Entries in a
`linux`, `windows` or `macos` table apply only on that system and win
over the shared ones. Restart prev after editing the file.

```toml
[keys]
export = "Ctrl+E"
find-next = ["Ctrl+G", "F3"]
crop = []

[keys.macos]
export = "Cmd+Shift+E"
```

A shortcut is modifiers and a key joined by `+`. `Ctrl` and `Cmd` both
mean the command key (⌘ on macOS, where Control is left to the system),
`Alt` and `Option` are the same key, and `Shift`. The key is a single
character or one of `Esc`, `Enter`, `Tab`, `Space`, `Backspace`,
`Delete`, `Insert`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Up`, `Down`,
`Left`, `Right` and `F1` to `F12`. The actions are:
open, close-window, quit, settings, print, full-screen, slideshow,
copy, paste, select-all, find, find-next, find-previous, zoom-in,
zoom-out, actual-size, zoom-to-fit, hide-sidebar, thumbnails, contents,
notes, bookmarks, markup, bookmark, go-to-page, rotate-left,
rotate-right, crop, undo, redo, adjust-color, inspector, export,
next-page, previous-page, first-page, last-page.

Menus on macOS and the hints prev shows name the shortcuts in effect.
Entries prev cannot read are listed in the Settings dialog, and the rest
still apply. Escape always closes and cancels.
